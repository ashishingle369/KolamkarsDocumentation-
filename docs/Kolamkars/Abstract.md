# Kolam Pattern Digitization and Analysis

This project presents a **comprehensive Python-based solution** that leverages India's cultural heritage by automating the identification of design principles in Kolam patterns such as **symmetry, repetition, and geometric transformations**.  

The system not only **recreates traditional designs programmatically** but also provides **innovative features for cultural preservation and educational applications**.

## Key Highlights

- **Digitization of Traditional Kolam Art**  
  Detects dots, lines, and geometric patterns in Kolam using advanced Deep Learning models.  

- **Deep Learning Models Used**  
  - **ResNet50** – for feature extraction.  
  - **Faster R-CNN** – for object detection (dots, lines, curves).  
  - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – for relational understanding of design structures.  

- **Step-by-Step Kolam Creation**  
  A unique feature of the system is its ability to **demonstrate the gradual, step-by-step process** of Kolam creation, offering valuable insights into traditional design methodology.

## Applications

- **Cultural Preservation** – Digitally archive and analyze traditional Kolam art.  
- **Education** – Teach mathematical and geometric concepts through Kolam.  
- **Innovation** – Enable modern applications such as AR/VR, design generation, and cultural AI.
