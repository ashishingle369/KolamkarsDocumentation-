Cybersecurity Overview
=======================

1. What is Cybersecurity?
-------------------------
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, data, and digital assets from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or disruption.

In simple words: Cybersecurity = Protecting digital information and systems from attacks or misuse.

2. Why Cybersecurity Matters
----------------------------
- Data protection: Prevents theft of sensitive information.
- Business continuity: Reduces downtime from attacks and failures.
- Compliance & regulations: Meets standards like HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001.
- Financial protection: Avoids costs from breaches and lawsuits.
- Trust: Builds customer and stakeholder confidence.

3. Key Elements of Cybersecurity (CIA Triad)
--------------------------------------------
- Confidentiality: Only authorized access allowed (e.g., encrypted hospital data).
- Integrity: Ensures accuracy of data (e.g., secure bank records).
- Availability: Systems/data must be accessible (e.g., 24/7 e-commerce).

4. Types of Cybersecurity
-------------------------
1. Network Security
2. Application Security
3. Endpoint Security
4. Cloud Security
5. Data Security
6. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
7. Operational Security (OpSec)
8. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

5. Cyber Threats & Attacks
--------------------------
- Malware
- Ransomware
- Phishing
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- SQL Injection
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
- Zero-day Exploits
- Insider Threats

6. Cybersecurity Frameworks & Standards
---------------------------------------
- ISO 27001
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- HIPAA
- GDPR
- PCI DSS

7. Defense Strategies
---------------------
- Firewalls & IPS
- Encryption
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Patch Management
- Zero Trust Model
- Security Awareness Training
- SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, Response)
- Incident Response Planning (IRP)

8. Modern Cybersecurity Concepts
--------------------------------
- Zero Trust Security
- CAASM (Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management)
- XDR (Extended Detection & Response)
- AI in Cybersecurity
- Auto-Remediation

9. Cybersecurity Metrics (KPI)
------------------------------
- MTTR (Mean Time to Remediate)
- % of assets patched
- Number of incidents per quarter
- % of outdated assets active
- Downtime hours due to cyber incidents

10. Future of Cybersecurity
---------------------------
- More AI & automation
- Integration with IT Asset Management (ITAM)
- Cloud-native security
- Stricter compliance requirements
- Focus on resilience and recovery
